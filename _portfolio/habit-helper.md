Demo is live at [https://habit-helper.netlify.app/](https://habit-helper.netlify.app/)

An experiment in creating a gamified calendar-based habit tracker. Used Svelte for the first time and found it very productive compared to React.

Fully front-end, no back-end. Data is stored in local storage. Lack of synchronization across multiple devices is a dealbreaker for serious usage, at least for me.
