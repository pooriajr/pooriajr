They contracted me to help build gamification features.

Most of these features used StimulusJS and StimulusReflex to create user interfaces that you wouldn't normally see on a website.

Here is a video of one such feature, a "hand" concept, like you'd find in a card game. It uses long presses and contextual menus to allow users to put cards in their hand, which unlock features in the site.
