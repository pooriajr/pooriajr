Jazz Bouquet contracted me to establish their online presence. Their goal was to get more sales via Google searches.

To meet that goal, I:
- Rebuilt their website with a focus on SEO keywords and conversion via social proof
- Systemetized their process for getting Google reviews (a big factor specifically in local SEO)
- Created new branding material for placement around town (example: Rack Card pictured above)
- Negotiated with local wedding venues, photographers, etc to trade backlinks for further SEO gains
