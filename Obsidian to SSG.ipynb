       "\"Well, that's a mouthful of a title.\\n\\nBut yeah, I've been wanting to streamline my publishing process for these daily blog posts, and  I thought it would be a good way to practice writing a simple Ruby automation.\\n\\nI've long been jealous of python users and their Jupyter Notebooks, which seem so good for experimenting and iteratively building something where you don't really know how it's going to all come together.\\n\\nTurns out, there's a plugin to use Ruby in Jupyter!\\n\\nI used it for making an automation script to publish these posts, so that I can use obsidian for writing, and then my SSG for publishing.\\n\\nThis is nice because one of the most annoying parts of writing a post in my SSG flow is images. I have to move the images I want to use into finder, decide on a name, and then type out the path to that image file in my post.\\n\\nObsidian makes it easy to upload photos - just drag and drop - and my script copies the photos for you!\\n\\nThere are other things that I can add to the script to make it better, such as handling links, but for now it's good enough.\\n\\n\""
