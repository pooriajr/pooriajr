They contracted me to help build gamification features.

Most of these features used StimulusJS and StimulusReflex to create user interfaces that you wouldn't normally see on a website.

## A few features

### Hand

I built the UI and backend functionality for a "hand", like you'd find in a card game. It uses long presses and contextual menus to allow users to put cards in their hand, which unlock features in the site.

### Burning

I built the UI for burning cards to convert them into coins, one of RCRDSHP's in-game tokens. Holding down the fire makes it grow, but you can let it go to interrupt the burn.
