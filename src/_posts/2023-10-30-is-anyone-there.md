title: Is anyone there?
---
Pretty sure no one is reading my (almost) daily blog posts.

It probably doesn't help that my daily publishing requirement pushes me to focus on quantity over quality. People don't want to waste their time reading low-effort stuff.

I like that I notice myself not really minding all that much that if people aren't reading. These are small posts, very litttle is at stake, so I don't get upset if I don't get any feedback.

That means the small joy I get from sticking to my goal is enough to make it a net positive experience.

If I was really investing a lot in them and they were failing, that would feel pretty bad.

I'm glad that I'm still doing it though, and strengthening my writing muscle!
