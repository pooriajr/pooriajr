Emotions are fickle.

As much as we would like to always "follow our heart", experience teaches us that our emotions can make fools of us.

Our emotions can make us want something so much that we turn our world upside down to get it.

And then emotions can flip on a dime and make us want nothing more than to throw away everything we worked so hard for.

That's not a wise way to operate, and it's bound to lead to unnecessary suffering.

When a strong emotion arises, the instinct is to act on it, and quickly.

But we can wait them out.

As we wait, we can examine the emotion. Through examination, we dispel the mystery and see the source of it.

And once we've found the source, we know whether the emotion is worth heeding.
