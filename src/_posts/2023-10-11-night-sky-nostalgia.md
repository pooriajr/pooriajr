Today while taking a walk under a starry sky with my family, we reminisced about the days when my siblings were kids and we all played on the trampoline.

And I imagined myself, 15 years from now, reminiscing about the days I took a night hike with my family under a starry sky.

If you ever catch yourself feeling nostalgic about a time that passed and will never return...

Remember that one day, you will remember this moment in that same fond way.

Cherish it now, and cherish it later.
