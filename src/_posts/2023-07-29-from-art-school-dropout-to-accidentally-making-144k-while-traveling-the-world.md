This is not a brag. 

This is a series of lucky accidents in my twenties that somehow led to what I consider "success".

If you're in your early or mid twenties, doubting whether you'll succeed, this story is for you.

## The moment

When I was 21 years old, I dropped out of art school. I had 1 year left to graduate.

It was an emotional decision, not a rational one. I remember looking at my courses for the semester:

- Art History 3 (memorize dates, artist names)
- English 1 (been putting that one off)
- Painting 2 (that's an easy A)
- Persian 3 (I'm already fluent, just taking it for easy credits)

Why am I even doing this? 

I picked art as my major because I wanted to take it easy in college. Enjoy my freedom, make friends, have fun.

And here I was, 3 years in, frustrated over these pointless classes. You reap what you sow.

I thought about the $140 textbooks I'd have to buy and never read. About spending my time and energy getting good grades that no one gave a shit about. 

A whole year.

All for what? It wouldn't help me get a job. Artists don't get hired for their credentials. They get hired for being exceptional. And they only get that good because they're obsessed, sacrificing everything else to focus on their art.

That wasn't me. My heart wasn't in it like that. I could never be a professional artist. I was fooling myself, wasting my time.

I decided I wanted to leave the "traditional" path. Rather than get a degree, get a job, get a house, and all that, I'd make my own path.

I wanted to be free to travel the world, to work on whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, from wherever I wanted.

I'd drop out, and become a freelance graphic designer.

## How not to be a freelance graphic designer 

I had been working part time as a designer at my University, getting paid $10/hour.

But that job was for students, so when I dropped out, I had to quit.

No worries, I'd make way more as a freelancer!

I got my first gig on Craigslist. $30/hour! I agonized over the work. I wanted it to be perfect. 6 hours later, I proudly sent him the work.

"It looks good, but come on, this was not 6 hours of work. Don't try and bullshit me."

He paid me for 3 hours, then cut contact. 

I had to find more clients. It was hard. Big business had design teams. Small ones didn't care that much about design.

I didn't find more clients. 

## A job is good too

I gave up on the freelance thing, and got hired at an 8 man startup. $15/hour making infographics for their blog.

I was thrilled. 

This was a big raise from my last job, and I was finally making more money than I was spending.
I had my own desk with my own computer. I made friends with my new coworkers. We talked work drama over lunch.
I felt stable, like I had found somewhere that I was useful and wanted.

Maybe I wouldn't just be a loser dropout forever.

## The bribe

My boss was struggling to hire a web developer. He asked me if I would study web development in my free time, so I could help out.

No. Not interested.

I was an artist, a creative. I had peeked over my roommate's shoulder while he worked on his Computer Science coursework. Seeing that wall of nonsense text and symbols made me recoil. No thanks, not for me.

A few weeks later, boss came back.

"We really need help with this. Can you put aside the design work for the next 2 weeks and just watch tutorials? We'll pay you like normal."

Get paid to sit there watching videos? OK, deal.

Day 1, HTML basics, I was surprised how simple it was
Day 2, CSS basics, I had fun getting creative with visual design
Day 3, started learning Javascript, and I realized...

Oh shit...

I think I like this.

## Switch lanes

The more I learned web dev, the more I liked it. By the end of my 2 weeks training, I was sold. This is going to be my career.

Goodbye under-appreciated artist, hello in-demand programmer.

6 months later, office drama was getting crazy. Super toxic. I got out.

3 months later I got hired as a front-end developer at a respectable agency. 

They offered me $56k/year. I was paying $275/month in rent, sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 people. I couldn't spend all that money if I tried.

That job became everything to me. My parents were proud of me. My siblings were envious. It was proof that I could still become something, even without a degree.

You know how companies say "we're a family"? It really felt like that. I showed up to work every morning with a big smile. 

Until they laid me off.

## Aight I'm out

It came out of nowhere. 

That morning I walked in smiling, that evening I walked out carrying my stuff in a box.

But even when I left for the last time, I was still smiling.

I realized they had done me a favor. I would have never quit that job on my own. But now, laid off, I had no more excuses, and a bunch of money saved up.

It was finally time to travel the world. 

So I traveled for about 4 years. I kept my expenses low, traveling to cheaper countries, staying in cheap hostels, eating cheap local food. I even traveled with a single bag, which made flying way cheaper.

I freelanced along the way, but I didn't work hard. My priority was to enjoy my travels, not to work.

Many months I didn't work at all. My savings gave me freedom. I was constantly thanking my past self for being frugal even though I could have lived more lavishly on my salary.

So I chased my whims, lazily moving from place to place, living in the wind.

## Back to work

Eventually I wanted to find a job again. My savings weren't bottomless. And I felt and urge to be a part of something again. I was feeling too isolated.

But my ego was threatened.

For years people had been asking me "when are you gonna go back and get your degree? When are you gonna get a job again? Why not go back to where you were before? Maybe they'll hire you again."

But going back to what I had before would feel like a failure. Like admitting defeat. No, if I was gonna get a job, it had to be something bigger, better.

And for my salary, I wanted to double it.

Since my last job had been 56k, now I wanted to make 112k! Yeah, that'll show everyone! (Oh shit that's a lot though)

So I started applying. A lot. And got rejected. A lot. It was demoralizing. I wondered if my years of carefree adventure had made me unemployable. 

After 3 months of rejections, I was in Discord complaining to a guy I'd just met, let's call him "L". 

Me: I bombed that interview because I don't use React much

L: My sense is that you should reach out to T and interview with R

Me: Ok, thanks for the tip, I'll look into them

- 2 minutes later

Me: Oh, looks like they want someone very senior, 10 years of experience. I've got ~3 years experience with Rails

L: Again, I'd ping them. You miss every shot you don't take.

This little exchange with L changed my life. And if he hadn't pushed back on me, I would have let it go. Life is crazy.

## Getting my dream job

I had an interview call on Friday, and realized I wanted to job. A lot. In fact, I realized I wanted that job more than any job I had ever wanted before. 

On the call they mentioned wanting to have really awesome animations in the app, so I spent the weekend building an animation demo that I hoped would knock their socks off.

When I finally emailed them the demo, I was so nervous. 

What if they're too busy and don't see it. What if they already hired someone while I was busy making this thing? What if it doesn't work properly on their computers? What if I just wasted all that time for nothing? How stupid am I, thinking I can get a job like this instead of just sending my resume like a normal person?

No response for a day. 2 days. Then, a response. It's a screenshot of the CEO seeing my demo and saying "please instahire"

A few days later, I signed the contract. They offered me 12k/month, which comes out to 32k MORE than my 112k/year target. 

I couldn't believe it.

## Easy come, easy go

Everything was amazing at the start. I had gotten in early on a startup that couldn't fail. We were like an all-star team. We were growing fast, changing the world, adored by our customers.

In the back of my mind, I wondered if it was too good to be true. But I wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth. I did my best work and enjoyed the crap out of it.

But soon our rapid rise became a meteoric fall. Layoffs and cutbacks. I didn't make it to 1 year. (So I didn't actually make 144k. Sorry for the clickbait.)

But that job taught me something I didn't expect it to teach me. It taught me that I've been underestimating myself. 

There I was, working on a team of guys with way more experience than me, and I belonged. I earned my place there. My work was valued and celebrated.

It was indisputable proof that even without a degree, or formal education, or even an extraordinary work ethic, I can live a life that my parents would be proud of, that my friends would admire.

At the moment of writing this, I no longer have that level of "success". I'm unemployed, except this time I'm not even freelancing. I'm spending my savings and working on creating something of my own. Soon I might have to pick up some contract work again. 

If I do go back to work, there's a good chance it won't pay as well as my last job. There were a numerous factors there which led me to get extra lucky. Luck and timing are too important to ignore.

But if my next job is a "downgrade" from my last one, that's ok. My ego is less concerned now.

It can rest, for a while a least, secure in the knowledge that we did it. It may have been brief, but we became "successful".
