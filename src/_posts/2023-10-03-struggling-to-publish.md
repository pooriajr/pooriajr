Hey, reader! 

Today is Day 13 of my self-imposed challenge to publish a blog post 100 days in a row.

Guess what? This is hard!

Some nights I'm low on time, and even more low on energy. 

Last night, I published a blog post that was merely 4 pictures I took an hour before. 

I don't consider it "breaking the rules" to experiment with blog posts that emphasize mediums other than writing.

Actually, I really like that kind of experimentation and breaking of norms.

But I chose this challenge mostly because I want to do a lot of writing.

## Writing fast and slow

But writing takes a lot more time.

Normally when I write, I tend to obsess over word choice and sentence structure until it feels *just right*.

I also tend to be careful about what I publish. 

I don't want to put out something low effort, useless, or disingenuous.

But, I think that one of the useful parts of this challenge is that it's going to push me to lower my bar a little bit on what I think is worthy of putting out into the world.

It's better to err on too much confidence than too little, especially when you're someone like me who tends to be more self-critical.

## Endings are hard

I've said what I want to say, and now I just need to tie it up in some way that feels satisfyingly conclusive.

But this is the hardest part for me. 

I could end this post with a weak ending.

Just to see how it feels.
