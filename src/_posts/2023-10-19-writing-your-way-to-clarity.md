title: Writing your way to clarity
---
One of the most useful things I've discovered in my life:

No matter how lost and confused I feel, if I sit down and force myself to write for a couple hours, I will come out of it with clarity and direction.

It's like a magic trick, and every time I go through it, I am surprised to see it still works.

It's just so simple that it doesn't seem like it should be so powerful.

In fact, it's so simple that I don't really have anything more to say on it!
